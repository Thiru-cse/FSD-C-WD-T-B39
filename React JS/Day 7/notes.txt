useCallback, useMemo, useRef, useReducer, Router.

useMemo and useCallback: Memoize values and functions to optimize performance.
                         Avoiding unnecessary re-render.

useRef:
- useRef to access to DOM Elements, manage Focus
- Aref is like "Magical Pointer" that allows you to interact directly with a specific DOM Element.
- useRef() only returns one item. it return as object called Currect(focus(), value)
- don't trigger a re-render of the component but state managed.

- it is similar to the useState Hook.
- It allows for custom state logic.
- if you find yourself keeping track of a group of state that rely on complex logic.
- useReducer Hook return the current state value and dispatch method.
