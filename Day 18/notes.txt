Day 18 

Javascript: Single threated execute single task at the time.

Synchronous: which execute all the code line by line.(Block)

Asynchronous: Programming you can do task without waiting for a task to complete,
              it execution(Non-blocking)

setTimeout(): This method execute a function, after waiting specific number of millisecond.

Syntax:
setTimeout(function, millisecond);

Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Day 18 - JS</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>setTimeout</h1>
    <button onclick="setTimeout(timeout, 5000)">Submit</button>

<script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

SCRIPT:
function timeout() {
    console.log("TimeOut");
}

TASK: Print on HTML.(Download Completed after 5secs)

setInterval(): This method repeat a given function at every given time interval.

Syntax:
setInterval(function, millisecond);

Example:
<button onclick="setInterval(timeout, 5000)">Submit</button>

Example:

console.log("Started");

setTimeout(function timer() {
    console.log("2secs Delay");
}, 2000);

console.log("Middle");

setTimeout(function timer() {
    console.log("5s Delay");
}, 5000);

console.log("Completed");

1. CallStack: it is place in browser where it keep tracks the function that has to be called in a diagram.
              it will be executed where the statement inside.

2. Web API: it is place where the Async operation are actually executed.

3. Event Queue: Queue is data structure First Come First Out(FIFO)
                it stores the Async function which has to be executed next.

4. Event Loop: it is between call stack as well as the Event Queue.
               the main role of the event loop is whether the call stack is empty or not.
               if it is empty it will push the code from Queue and it to call stack.
               the call stack ececute the function.

Callback Hell: 

Example:
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("First");
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Second");
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log("Third");
        },2000)
    },4000)
},2000)

console.log("End");

Task: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 - Happy New Year!

Promise: it holds the result of async operation.
Need of Promise: to overcome Callback hell scenerio.
it is an object, which is holds result of the operation.

Syntax:
var variableName = new Promise((resolve, reject));

For every promise object we have state,
1. Pending
2. Fullfilled(resolve)
3. Rejected

Example:
var a = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (5 < 0) {
        resolve("Success");
    } else {
        reject("Rejected");
    }
})

console.log(a);
